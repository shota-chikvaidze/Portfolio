## 🎨 Design System

### Theme Architecture

The entire UI is built on a comprehensive CSS variable system with **60+ custom properties** for complete theme control:

#### Color Variables
```css
--text-primary: #E3E3E3           /* Primary text */
--text-secondary: rgba(227,227,227,0.8)  /* Secondary text */
--text-muted: rgba(255,255,255,0.6)      /* Muted text */
--border-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.1)    /* Borders & dividers */
--glass-overlay: rgba(255,255,255,0.04)  /* Glass morphism effects */
--modal-overlay: rgba(0,0,0,0.7)         /* Modal backdrops */
--accent: [Gradient/Accent color]        /* Highlight color */
--bg-dark: [Background color]            /* Main background */
```

#### Benefits
- **Consistent Design** - Single source of truth for all colors
- **Easy Theming** - Change variables to switch entire color scheme
- **Maintainable** - No hardcoded colors throughout the codebase
- **Scalable** - Add new themes without touching components

## 🔐 Authentication System

### Implementation Details

**State Management**
- Zustand store with `persist` middleware
- Auto-saves to localStorage as `user-auth-storage`
- Survives page refreshes and browser restarts

**Flow**
1. User logs in via admin login page
2. Backend validates credentials & sets HTTP-only cookie
3. Frontend stores user data in Zustand + localStorage
4. `useCurrentUser` hook validates session on mount
5. Protected routes check auth state before rendering

**Security Features**
- HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Admin middleware protects backend routes
- Automatic session validation

## 📊 State Management Strategy

### Global State (Zustand)
- **User Authentication** - With localStorage persistence
- **Theme Settings** - User preferences

### Server State (TanStack Query)
- **Projects** - CRUD operations with optimistic updates
- **Contacts** - Fetch and delete operations
- **Current User** - Session validation

### Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear distinction between client and server state
- **Automatic Caching** - TanStack Query handles cache invalidation
- **Optimistic Updates** - Instant UI feedback before server response
- **Error Handling** - Centralized error management with toast notifications
